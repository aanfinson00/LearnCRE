# LearnCRE — Interview question reference

A curated reference of common CRE interview questions, mapped to the LearnCRE
content that drills the underlying skill (or flagged as a `GAP — propose new
content`). Used as the evidence base for which content to build next.

**Important honesty note on sources.** This file is a starter set written from
the broad pattern of CRE interview-prep literature (A.CRE, Wall Street Oasis
public threads, Reddit `r/CommercialRealEstate`, Breaking Into Wall Street CRE
primers, GP Equity Mentor / Joseph Stampone published posts, public LinkedIn
posts). The questions are *representative* — they're the kinds of things that
appear in real interviews — but the specific URLs are not pinned for each.
The goal is for a future contributor to verify each against a public source
and fill in `Source:` URLs over time.

**How to read this.** Each question has:
- the question text (paraphrased to remove company-specific framing)
- `Role:` the position(s) where it's most-asked
- `Difficulty:` rough proxy for how senior the asker likely is
- `Maps to:` the LearnCRE template / situational / walkthrough id, OR
  `GAP` with a proposed addition

Last edit cadence: as content lands, update the `Maps to:` lines. When a new
case study is curated, add it here first, then propose the `Maps to:` content
in a future PR.

## Development (17)

_Smallest role bucket in this doc and, per a 2026-08-10 pass, the thinnest in
the live app too — `development` is the least-used role tag across
`src/quiz/templates` + `src/quiz/situational` (19 tags vs. 35–100 for every
other role, and it never appears as a lone role in the situational set —
always paired with `mortgageUw` or `acquisitions`). The 7 original questions
below are now fully mapped; the 10 new entries are fresh proposals to close
that gap._

### Q: Land cost $8M, hard cost $38M, soft $7M, 5% contingency. What's TPC and what's the yield-on-cost on $4.5M stabilized NOI?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** intermediate
- **Why:** standard feasibility-walkthrough opener.
- **Maps to:** `walk-dev-feasibility-1` walkthrough.

### Q: Yield on cost is 6.5%; market cap is 5%. Does this deal pencil for development risk?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** intermediate
- **Why:** dev-spread vs threshold reasoning.
- **Maps to:** `devSpread` quiz template + `DevSpreadViz`.

### Q: 4,000-unit submarket, 85% leased, +300 units delivering, 50/mo absorption. How long to 95%?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** intermediate
- **Why:** absorption math with deliveries — easy to get the denominator wrong.
- **Maps to:** `absorption-timing` situational.

### Q: What's a healthy land-cost-as-%-TPC for mid-rise multifamily? What if it's at 30%?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** intermediate
- **Why:** sanity-check on dev cost structure.
- **Maps to:** `walk-dev-feasibility-1` Step 3.

### Q: Construction loan sizing on a $50M TPC dev with 65% LTC. What's the equity check?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** intermediate
- **Why:** LTC-vs-LTV distinction; common at debt funds + GC-side.
- **Maps to:** `constructionLoanSizing` quiz template + `dev-ltc-vs-ltv` situational. _(closed since last edit — was flagged GAP)_

### Q: How do you size a lease-up reserve on a development that stabilizes year 2-3?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** intermediate
- **Why:** lease-up risk pricing; common in development-side underwriting.
- **Maps to:** `leaseUpReserve` quiz template. _(closed since last edit — was flagged GAP)_

### Q: Ground lease vs fee-simple on a development site — what changes in your underwriting?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** advanced
- **Why:** ground-lease economics; common at urban infill developers.
- **Maps to:** `groundLeaseVsFee` situational. _(closed since last edit — was flagged GAP)_

### Q: Entitlement approval slips 9 months and you're carrying $180K/month in land debt and soft costs during the delay — how does that flow through your yield-on-cost, and what's your move?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** intermediate
- **Why:** entitlement/carry-cost risk is one of the most common "what can go wrong" follow-ups after a feasibility walkthrough, and it's currently untested in the bank.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `entitlementDelayCarryCost` situational**.

### Q: Your GC comes back with a GMP contract carrying a 5% fee and 8% contingency, versus a cost-plus contract with a 4% fee and no cap. Which do you push for, and why?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** intermediate
- **Why:** GMP vs cost-plus is a standard construction-finance filter question that tests risk-allocation reasoning, distinct from the bank's existing cost-overrun and change-order content.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `gmpVsCostPlusContract` situational**.

### Q: You're underwriting a 250-unit deal with a choice between a 1.1/unit surface parking ratio and a 1.6/unit structured deck. Walk me through how that choice moves your TPC and your rents.
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** intermediate
- **Why:** parking ratio is a first-order lever on hard cost and achievable rent that candidates are expected to reason through quantitatively.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `parkingRatioTpcTradeoff` quiz template**.

### Q: Phase II ESA comes back with contamination requiring a $1.2M remediation. How does that change your basis, your timeline, and would you still close?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** advanced
- **Why:** environmental risk is a real go/no-go filter in ground-up development interviews and isn't covered anywhere in the current bank.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `environmentalRemediationBasis` situational**.

### Q: Your construction lender requires 60% pre-leasing before funding the last draw. You're at 40% pre-leased with 4 months left on your commitment period. What are your options?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** advanced
- **Why:** pre-leasing covenants are a common construction-loan mechanic that tests understanding of lender risk controls, distinct from the bank's existing draw-mechanics and retainage content.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `preLeasingCovenantShortfall` situational**.

### Q: A city offers a density bonus — 20% more units — in exchange for a 10% affordable set-aside at 60% AMI rents. Does taking the bonus improve your yield-on-cost?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** advanced
- **Why:** density-bonus math (more units at reduced rent vs fewer units at market rent) is a common zoning-driven underwriting question.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `densityBonusAffordableTradeoff` quiz template**.

### Q: Your GC's hard cost bid comes in $4M over your budgeted number. Walk me through your value-engineering options before you go back to your equity partner.
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** intermediate
- **Why:** value-engineering triage is the natural next question after a cost-overrun feasibility check, and is a distinct skill from the existing "how do you fund an overrun" situational.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `valueEngineeringTriage` situational**.

### Q: You're $6M short on your construction budget after a hard-cost repricing. Do you fill the gap with additional sponsor equity, a mezz piece, or a GP-side preferred equity raise?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** advanced
- **Why:** capital-stack gap-filling choice tests cost-of-capital and dilution tradeoffs specific to construction-stage financing — complementary to, but distinct from, the bank's existing LPA/capital-call content (which is asset-mgmt/portfolio framed, not development-stage).
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `constructionGapFillingCapital` situational**.

### Q: How is your developer fee structured on this deal — earned current vs deferred until stabilization — and how does that change your incentive to hit budget and schedule?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** intermediate
- **Why:** developer-fee mechanics (and how they align or misalign incentives) is a standard question at development shops and is untested in the current bank.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `developerFeeStructuring` situational**.

### Q: You're weighing build-to-core (hold post-stabilization) against build-to-sell (dispose at stabilization). Walk me through how that decision changes your promote structure and your exit-cap assumption.
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** advanced
- **Why:** build-to-core vs build-to-sell is a core strategic decision at development shops that ties together promote mechanics and exit-cap discipline — the bank's current waterfall content is acquisitions/asset-mgmt framed, not development-stage framed.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `buildToCoreVsSell` situational**.

- **Role:** all · **Difficulty:** advanced
- **Why:** distressed underwriting; increasingly relevant 2024+.
- **Maps to:** `walk-distressed-1` walkthrough. _(closed since last edit — was flagged GAP)_

## Summary statistics

_Updated 2026-08-10 — re-audited every `GAP` marker against the current
`src/quiz/templates` + `src/quiz/situational` + `walkthroughs.ts` trees. Eight
of the original nine GAPs had already shipped and were stale; only the
portfolio-mgmt promote walkthrough (explicitly deferred per ROADMAP) is still
open. Ten new Development questions were added below — Development was both
the smallest section in this doc (7 questions) and the least-tagged role in
the live app (19 role tags vs. 35–100 for every other role, never appearing
as a lone role in the situational set)._

- **Total questions in this doc:** 62
- **Mapped to existing content:** 47 (76%)
- **Flagged as GAPs:** 11 (18%) — 10 new (development), 1 carried over (portfolio mgmt, deferred per ROADMAP)
- **Out of scope (time-sensitive / behavioral):** 4 (6%)

Top GAPs to address (ranked by interview frequency):

1. `entitlementDelayCarryCost` situational (development)
2. `gmpVsCostPlusContract` situational (development)
3. `valueEngineeringTriage` situational (development)
4. `preLeasingCovenantShortfall` situational (development)
5. `developerFeeStructuring` situational (development)
6. `parkingRatioTpcTradeoff` quiz template (development)
7. `constructionGapFillingCapital` situational (development)
8. `densityBonusAffordableTradeoff` quiz template (development)
9. `environmentalRemediationBasis` situational (development)
10. `buildToCoreVsSell` situational (development)
11. `1-tier-promote-walk` walkthrough (portfolio mgmt, deferred per ROADMAP)

Development is now the doc's priority queue — closing even 3-4 of these would
give the smallest-tagged role in the live app real standalone coverage
instead of only ever showing up paired with `mortgageUw` or `acquisitions`.
