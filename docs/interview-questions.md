# LearnCRE — Interview question reference

A curated reference of common CRE interview questions, mapped to the LearnCRE
content that drills the underlying skill (or flagged as a `GAP — propose new
content`). Used as the evidence base for which content to build next.

**Important honesty note on sources.** This file is a starter set written from
the broad pattern of CRE interview-prep literature (A.CRE, Wall Street Oasis
public threads, Reddit `r/CommercialRealEstate`, Breaking Into Wall Street CRE
primers, GP Equity Mentor / Joseph Stampone published posts, public LinkedIn
posts). The questions are *representative* — they're the kinds of things that
appear in real interviews — but the specific URLs are not pinned for each.
The goal is for a future contributor to verify each against a public source
and fill in `Source:` URLs over time.

**How to read this.** Each question has:
- the question text (paraphrased to remove company-specific framing)
- `Role:` the position(s) where it's most-asked
- `Difficulty:` rough proxy for how senior the asker likely is
- `Maps to:` the LearnCRE template / situational / walkthrough id, OR
  `GAP` with a proposed addition

Last edit cadence: as content lands, update the `Maps to:` lines. When a new
case study is curated, add it here first, then propose the `Maps to:` content
in a future PR.

## Summary statistics

- **Total questions in this doc:** 62
- **Mapped to existing content:** 48 (77%)
- **Flagged as GAPs:** 10 (16%)
- **Out of scope (time-sensitive / behavioral):** 4 (6%)

**2026-09-01 update:** every GAP from the original 52-question pass has since
shipped (`capexReserveSizing`, `refiStressTest`, `feeDragOnIrr` +
`fund-vs-deal-irr-gap`, `constructionLoanSizing` + `dev-ltc-vs-ltv`,
`leaseUpReserve`, `groundLeaseVsFee`, `capital-allocation-priority`,
`risk-adjusted-return-framework`, and `walk-distressed-1` / `walk-waterfall-1`
for the 3-tier promote walk). Coverage-audit of the actual content bank
(`src/quiz/situational/` + `src/quiz/templates/`, tagged by `roles`) shows
**development is now the thinnest role by a wide margin** — 9 of 71
situational cases and 10 of 68 quiz templates, versus 19–40 and 16–60
respectively for the other four roles. The ten new GAP items above are
candidate phrasings aimed at closing that gap; none are built yet.

| --- | --- | --- |
| acquisitions | 40 | 60 |
| assetManagement | 31 | 20 |
| portfolioMgmt | 25 | 16 |
| mortgageUw | 19 | 16 |
