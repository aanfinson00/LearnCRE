# LearnCRE — Interview question reference

A curated reference of common CRE interview questions, mapped to the LearnCRE
content that drills the underlying skill (or flagged as a `GAP — propose new
content`). Used as the evidence base for which content to build next.

**Important honesty note on sources.** This file is a starter set written from
the broad pattern of CRE interview-prep literature (A.CRE, Wall Street Oasis
public threads, Reddit `r/CommercialRealEstate`, Breaking Into Wall Street CRE
primers, GP Equity Mentor / Joseph Stampone published posts, public LinkedIn
posts). The questions are *representative* — they're the kinds of things that
appear in real interviews — but the specific URLs are not pinned for each.
The goal is for a future contributor to verify each against a public source
and fill in `Source:` URLs over time.

**How to read this.** Each question has:
- the question text (paraphrased to remove company-specific framing)
- `Role:` the position(s) where it's most-asked
- `Difficulty:` rough proxy for how senior the asker likely is
- `Maps to:` the LearnCRE template / situational / walkthrough id, OR
  `GAP` with a proposed addition

Last edit cadence: as content lands, update the `Maps to:` lines. When a new
case study is curated, add it here first, then propose the `Maps to:` content
in a future PR.

## Development (17)

### Q: Land cost $8M, hard cost $38M, soft $7M, 5% contingency. What's TPC and what's the yield-on-cost on $4.5M stabilized NOI?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** intermediate
- **Why:** standard feasibility-walkthrough opener.
- **Maps to:** `walk-dev-feasibility-1` walkthrough.

- **Why:** absorption math with deliveries — easy to get the denominator wrong.
- **Maps to:** `absorption-timing` situational.

### Q: What's a healthy land-cost-as-%-TPC for mid-rise multifamily? What if it's at 30%?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** intermediate
- **Why:** sanity-check on dev cost structure.
- **Maps to:** `walk-dev-feasibility-1` Step 3.

### Q: Construction loan sizing on a $50M TPC dev with 65% LTC. What's the equity check?

- **Why:** lease-up risk pricing; common in development-side underwriting.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `leaseUpReserve` quiz template**.

### Q: Ground lease vs fee-simple on a development site — what changes in your underwriting?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** advanced
- **Why:** ground-lease economics; common at urban infill developers.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `groundLeaseVsFee` situational**.

### Q: GAP — GC is proposing a GMP contract at a 4% fee; the alternative is cost-plus with a 6% fee and a shared-savings clause. How does the contract type change what risk you're underwriting?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** intermediate
- **Why:** GMP shifts cost overrun risk to the GC (at a price); cost-plus keeps it with the sponsor. Candidates who only compare the fee % miss the risk transfer.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `gmpVsCostPlus` situational**.

### Q: GAP — Hard costs come in $3M over budget mid-construction and your $2M contingency is exhausted. Where does the next dollar come from, and what does it do to your levered IRR?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** intermediate
- **Why:** contingency drawdown order (contingency → sponsor cash call → mezz/preferred equity → construction loan increase) is a common "walk me through what happens next" probe.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `contingencyExhaustionCascade` situational** (adjacent to the existing `contingencyDrawDown` template, but framed on what happens after contingency runs out, not just draw sequencing).

### Q: GAP — Site A is entitled and shovel-ready at a $12M basis. Site B is the same size, un-entitled, and priced at $8M with an 18-month rezoning timeline. How do you underwrite the difference?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** advanced
- **Why:** entitlement risk pricing — tests whether a candidate discounts for approval risk and carry cost, not just basis-per-unit.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `entitlementRiskPricing` situational**.

### Q: GAP — Your development fee is 4% of TPC on a $60M deal. Does that fee show up as income to the sponsor above the promote waterfall, or does it get netted into project cost first?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** advanced
- **Why:** development-fee mechanics and whether it's a return *of* capital vs a return *on* capital is frequently misunderstood; matters for GP economics.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `devFeeWaterfallTreatment` situational**.

### Q: GAP — Your construction loan matures in 3 months. The permanent lender's term sheet requires a 1.25x DSCR test at conversion, and the property is trending to 1.15x at current leasing. What are your options?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** advanced
- **Why:** construction-to-perm conversion risk — a very live topic in a higher-rate environment; tests knowledge of extension options, mezz bridge, rate buydowns, and earnout structures.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `constructionToPermConversionRisk` situational**.

### Q: GAP — Code requires 1.5 spaces/unit structured parking, adding $18k/unit to TPC. How much does that move your required rent, and at what parking ratio does the deal stop penciling?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** intermediate
- **Why:** parking/podium cost is one of the biggest swing variables in urban multifamily TPC; tests whether a candidate can translate a cost input into a required-rent breakeven.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `parkingRatioTpcSensitivity` situational**.

### Q: GAP — The jurisdiction's impact/tap fees for your submarket haven't been finalized and could land anywhere from $8k to $15k/unit. How do you handle that in your TPC and your bid?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** intermediate
- **Why:** municipal fee uncertainty is a real and underrated line-item risk; tests whether a candidate builds a contingency band into TPC or just picks a point estimate.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `impactFeeUncertainty` situational**.

### Q: GAP — On a stabilized acquisition, the promote hurdle is measured from day-one cash flow. On a ground-up development, there's no cash flow for 24+ months. How does the promote waterfall differ?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** advanced
- **Why:** development-JV waterfalls typically layer a preferred return that accrues (rather than pays currently) during construction/lease-up; tests whether a candidate understands accrual vs current-pay preferred return.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `devWaterfallAccrualVsCurrentPay` situational**.

### Q: GAP — You underwrote a 5.0% exit cap at delivery, 24 months out. Cap rates have since moved out 75 bps, but market rents have grown 6%. Does the deal still pencil, and how do you stress-test that race during construction?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** advanced
- **Why:** rent growth vs. cap-rate-expansion race is the core exit risk on any multi-year development hold; tests whether a candidate can net the two rather than reasoning about only one.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `devExitCapVsRentGrowthRace` situational**.

### Q: GAP — Two mid-rise multifamily deals have identical TPC and unit count. Deal A is a 12-month renovation-heavy value-add reposition; Deal B is a 24-month ground-up build. Why would a lender size the two very differently even at the same LTC?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** intermediate
- **Why:** tests whether a candidate understands that construction/entitlement risk, draw schedule, and completion guaranty requirements — not just LTC — drive a lender's spread and structure between heavy-reposition and ground-up deals.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `groundUpVsRepoLenderRisk` situational**.

## Cross-cutting / market awareness (5)

These appear across all roles — they're filters at first-round interviews
regardless of position.

### Q: What's interesting in CRE right now?
- **Role:** all · **Difficulty:** beginner
- **Why:** market-awareness filter; almost universal first question.
- **Maps to:** **OUT OF SCOPE — too time-sensitive to maintain in a content app**.

- **Role:** all · **Difficulty:** advanced
- **Why:** distressed underwriting; increasingly relevant 2024+.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `walk-distressed-1` walkthrough**.

## Summary statistics

- **Total questions in this doc:** 62
- **Mapped to existing content:** 38 (61%)
- **Flagged as GAPs:** 20 (32%)
- **Out of scope (time-sensitive / behavioral):** 4 (6%)

Development went from the smallest section in this doc (7 questions, tied
for fewest `Maps to:` content of any role) to the largest, via 10 new
phrasings added 2026-09-04 to close the gap — see "Development coverage
pass" below.

Top GAPs to address (ranked by interview frequency):

1. `capexReserveSizing` quiz + `capex-reserve-discipline` situational (asset mgmt)
2. `refiStressTest` quiz + `refi-cap-stress` situational (mortgage UW)
3. `fund-vs-deal-irr-gap` situational + `feeDragOnIrr` quiz (portfolio mgmt)
4. `constructionLoanSizing` quiz + `dev-ltc-vs-ltv` situational (development)
5. `walk-distressed-1` walkthrough (cross-cutting)

These five gaps would lift mapped-to-content coverage from 78% → ~93% with
~½ day of content work each, and they all surface from real interview-question
patterns rather than top-down design guesses.

### Development coverage pass (2026-09-04)

Automated review of the shipped question bank (`feedback/questions.json`)
and this doc found Development the most underrepresented role across both:
10 of 100 shipped questions (vs. 46 for acquisitions, 34 for asset
management, 29 for portfolio management) and only 7 of 52 entries in this
doc (fewest of any role section, with 3 already flagged GAP). Added 10 new
candidate phrasings above spanning capital-stack risk (GC contract type,
contingency exhaustion, construction-to-perm conversion, impact-fee
uncertainty), deal structuring (entitlement risk pricing, dev-fee
treatment, JV promote accrual during construction), and market risk
(parking-ratio TPC sensitivity, exit-cap-vs-rent-growth race) — chosen to
avoid overlap with the 7 existing Development entries. All 10 are GAPs
(phrasing only, no template/situational built yet); a future pass should
prioritize building content for whichever of these come up most in real
interview reports, same as the existing top-GAPs list above.
