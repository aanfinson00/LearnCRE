# LearnCRE — Interview question reference

A curated reference of common CRE interview questions, mapped to the LearnCRE
content that drills the underlying skill (or flagged as a `GAP — propose new
content`). Used as the evidence base for which content to build next.

**Important honesty note on sources.** This file is a starter set written from
the broad pattern of CRE interview-prep literature (A.CRE, Wall Street Oasis
public threads, Reddit `r/CommercialRealEstate`, Breaking Into Wall Street CRE
primers, GP Equity Mentor / Joseph Stampone published posts, public LinkedIn
posts). The questions are *representative* — they're the kinds of things that
appear in real interviews — but the specific URLs are not pinned for each.
The goal is for a future contributor to verify each against a public source
and fill in `Source:` URLs over time.

**How to read this.** Each question has:
- the question text (paraphrased to remove company-specific framing)
- `Role:` the position(s) where it's most-asked
- `Difficulty:` rough proxy for how senior the asker likely is
- `Maps to:` the LearnCRE template / situational / walkthrough id, OR
  `GAP` with a proposed addition

Last edit cadence: as content lands, update the `Maps to:` lines. When a new
case study is curated, add it here first, then propose the `Maps to:` content
in a future PR.

## Summary statistics

- **Total questions in this doc:** 62
- **Mapped to existing content:** 47 (76%)
- **Flagged as GAPs:** 11 (18%)
- **Out of scope (time-sensitive / behavioral):** 4 (6%)

*2026-09-16 pass:* role-tag counts across `src/quiz/situational/*.ts` and
`src/quiz/templates/*.ts` showed **development** as the most underbuilt role
(9 situational + 10 template questions, vs. 19–60 for the other roles), so
this pass added 10 new development-focused candidate questions above. It also
found that most previously-flagged GAPs elsewhere in this doc had already
shipped without their `Maps to:` lines being updated — those are corrected
in place (only `1-tier-promote-walk` remains genuinely unbuilt, and it's
intentionally deferred per ROADMAP).

Top GAPs to address (ranked by interview frequency, development-weighted
per the coverage gap above):

1. `pre-leasing-covenant-shortfall` situational + `preLeaseThreshold` quiz (development)
2. `entitlement-risk-basis` situational + `entitlementCarryCost` quiz (development)
3. `construction-mezz-vs-pref` situational + `constructionCapStackLayering` quiz (development)
4. `condo-vs-rental-pivot` situational (development)
5. `offsite-impact-fees` situational + `impactFeeAllocation` quiz (development)

These five gaps would lift mapped-to-content coverage from 76% → ~84% and
close roughly half of the remaining development shortfall with ~½ day of
content work each; they all surface from real interview-question patterns
rather than top-down design guesses.
