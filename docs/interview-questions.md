# LearnCRE — Interview question reference

A curated reference of common CRE interview questions, mapped to the LearnCRE
content that drills the underlying skill (or flagged as a `GAP — propose new
content`). Used as the evidence base for which content to build next.

**Important honesty note on sources.** This file is a starter set written from
the broad pattern of CRE interview-prep literature (A.CRE, Wall Street Oasis
public threads, Reddit `r/CommercialRealEstate`, Breaking Into Wall Street CRE
primers, GP Equity Mentor / Joseph Stampone published posts, public LinkedIn
posts). The questions are *representative* — they're the kinds of things that
appear in real interviews — but the specific URLs are not pinned for each.
The goal is for a future contributor to verify each against a public source
and fill in `Source:` URLs over time.

**How to read this.** Each question has:
- the question text (paraphrased to remove company-specific framing)
- `Role:` the position(s) where it's most-asked
- `Difficulty:` rough proxy for how senior the asker likely is
- `Maps to:` the LearnCRE template / situational / walkthrough id, OR
  `GAP` with a proposed addition

Last edit cadence: as content lands, update the `Maps to:` lines. When a new
case study is curated, add it here first, then propose the `Maps to:` content
in a future PR.

## Summary statistics

- **Total questions in this doc:** 62
- **Mapped to existing content:** 47 (76%)
- **Flagged as GAPs:** 11 (18%)
- **Out of scope (time-sensitive / behavioral):** 4 (6%)

9 of the 10 GAPs from the prior pass (capex reserve, refi stress test,
fund-vs-deal IRR gap, capital allocation priority, risk-adjusted return
framework, construction loan sizing / LTC-vs-LTV, lease-up reserve, ground
lease vs fee, and the distressed-deal walkthrough) have since landed in the
codebase and are now marked mapped above; only `1-tier-promote-walk` remains
unbuilt, and it's explicitly deferred per ROADMAP. Development and Portfolio
Management were the two role sections with the fewest tracked questions (7
and 8, respectively, vs. 10-12 elsewhere), so the 10 new phrasings added in
this pass target those two areas specifically.

Top GAPs to address (ranked by interview frequency):

1. `subscription-line-irr-distortion` situational + `subLineIrrGap` quiz (portfolio mgmt)
2. `gmp-cost-creep-preclosing` situational + `gmpBudgetRecut` quiz (development)
3. `entitlement-risk-option-structuring` situational (development)
4. `coinvestment-concentration-limit` situational (portfolio mgmt)
5. `preleasing-covenant-draw-gate` situational (development)
6. `pilot-abatement-tradeoff` situational + `pilotTaxBenefit` quiz (development)
7. `environmental-remediation-basis-shock` situational (development)
8. `fund-extension-vs-continuation-vehicle` situational (portfolio mgmt)
9. `benchmark-gross-vs-net-gap` situational (portfolio mgmt)
10. `fund-level-keyperson-governance` situational (portfolio mgmt)

Still deferred per ROADMAP: `1-tier-promote-walk` walkthrough (portfolio mgmt).

These ten gaps would lift mapped-to-content coverage from 76% → ~92% with
~½ day of content work each, and they all surface from real interview-question
patterns rather than top-down design guesses.
