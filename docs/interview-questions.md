# LearnCRE — Interview question reference

A curated reference of common CRE interview questions, mapped to the LearnCRE
content that drills the underlying skill (or flagged as a `GAP — propose new
content`). Used as the evidence base for which content to build next.

**Important honesty note on sources.** This file is a starter set written from
the broad pattern of CRE interview-prep literature (A.CRE, Wall Street Oasis
public threads, Reddit `r/CommercialRealEstate`, Breaking Into Wall Street CRE
primers, GP Equity Mentor / Joseph Stampone published posts, public LinkedIn
posts). The questions are *representative* — they're the kinds of things that
appear in real interviews — but the specific URLs are not pinned for each.
The goal is for a future contributor to verify each against a public source
and fill in `Source:` URLs over time.

**How to read this.** Each question has:
- the question text (paraphrased to remove company-specific framing)
- `Role:` the position(s) where it's most-asked
- `Difficulty:` rough proxy for how senior the asker likely is
- `Maps to:` the LearnCRE template / situational / walkthrough id, OR
  `GAP` with a proposed addition

Last edit cadence: as content lands, update the `Maps to:` lines. When a new
case study is curated, add it here first, then propose the `Maps to:` content
in a future PR.

- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `land-basis-contribution-markdown` situational**.

### Q: Your development agreement pays a 4% fee on TPC, half at closing and half at stabilization. How does that split change the sponsor's at-risk capital and the deal's effective promote hurdle?
- **Role:** development · **Difficulty:** intermediate

## Asset-class depth — Hotel & Retail (5)

Catalog audit (2026-08-31): situational coverage skews heavily toward
multifamily (11) and office (9), with hotel (1) and retail (2) the
thinnest asset classes in the bank. These five target that gap directly.

### Q: Your franchise agreement requires a $2.5M Property Improvement Plan (PIP) within 18 months of acquisition, on top of the standard 4%-of-revenue FF&E reserve. How do you underwrite that into your basis and your year-1 returns?
- **Role:** acquisitions / assetManagement · **Difficulty:** advanced · **Asset class:** hotel
- **Why:** brand-mandated PIP capex is a hotel-specific trap that doesn't show up in other asset classes.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `hotel-pip-capex-underwriting` situational**.

### Q: Trailing GOP margin came in at 32% against a 38% comp-set average at similar RevPAR. Where do you look first — rate, labor, or overhead?
- **Role:** assetManagement · **Difficulty:** intermediate · **Asset class:** hotel
- **Why:** classic hotel operating-diagnostic; tests whether the candidate separates top-line (RevPAR) from operating efficiency (GOP).
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `hotel-gop-margin-diagnostic` situational** (pairs with the existing `gopMargin` quiz template).

- **Why:** ADR-vs-occupancy tradeoff is the hotel analogue of the office rent-vs-concession tradeoff — a common revenue-management question.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `hotel-seasonal-revpar-lever` situational** (pairs with the existing `revparFromAdrOcc` quiz template).

### Q: Your grocery anchor's lease has a co-tenancy clause letting it cut rent to 50% (or terminate) if center occupancy drops below 70%. A junior box just went dark. What's your first move?
- **Role:** assetManagement / acquisitions · **Difficulty:** advanced · **Asset class:** retail
- **Why:** co-tenancy triggers are the retail-specific document-literacy trap most candidates have never actually read in a lease.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `retail-anchor-cotenancy-trigger` situational**.

### Q: A big-box tenant "goes dark" — keeps paying rent but stops operating. Does that violate the lease, and how does it affect the center's co-tenancy exposure and your exit marketing?
- **Role:** acquisitions / assetManagement · **Difficulty:** advanced · **Asset class:** retail
- **Why:** dark-store risk is distinct from a default — tests whether candidates know a paying-but-dark tenant is still a leasing problem.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `retail-dark-store-risk` situational**.

## Cross-cutting / market awareness (5)

These appear across all roles — they're filters at first-round interviews
regardless of position.

### Q: GAP — Walk me through a distressed deal: half-vacant, basis below replacement, equity wiped — does it pencil?
- **Role:** all · **Difficulty:** advanced
- **Why:** distressed underwriting; increasingly relevant 2024+.
- **Maps to:** **GAP — propose `walk-distressed-1` walkthrough**.

## Summary statistics

- **Total questions in this doc:** 62
- **Mapped to existing content:** 41 (66%)
- **Flagged as GAPs:** 18 (29%)
- **Out of scope (time-sensitive / behavioral):** 4 (6%)

Top GAPs to address (ranked by interview frequency):

1. `capexReserveSizing` quiz + `capex-reserve-discipline` situational (asset mgmt)
2. `refiStressTest` quiz + `refi-cap-stress` situational (mortgage UW)
3. `fund-vs-deal-irr-gap` situational + `feeDragOnIrr` quiz (portfolio mgmt)
4. `constructionLoanSizing` quiz + `dev-ltc-vs-ltv` situational (development)
5. `walk-distressed-1` walkthrough (cross-cutting)

**2026-08-31 depth pass — added 10.** A catalog audit (see
`git log` / ROADMAP "Question-base depth pass") found the live content skew
still runs heavily toward `acquisitions` (40 of 95 situational-role tags) and
`multifamily`/`office` (20 of 34 situational assetClass tags), with
`development` the thinnest role across every content type (situational,
longform, *and* walkthroughs) and `hotel`/`retail` the thinnest asset
classes. The 5 new Development questions and 5 new Hotel & Retail questions
above target that gap directly — none are mapped yet, all are net-new GAPs.

These five gaps would lift mapped-to-content coverage from 78% → ~93% with
~½ day of content work each, and they all surface from real interview-question
patterns rather than top-down design guesses.
